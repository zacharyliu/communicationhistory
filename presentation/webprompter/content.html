<ul>
<li>THE MAMLUKS</li>
<li>THE ELITE RULERS OF THE MUSLIM WORLD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 2 
<ul>
<li>First off, we&rsquo;ll clarify something so you don&rsquo;t get too confused. The word &ldquo;Mamluk&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;owned&rdquo; and can refer to two things: the slave, or the dynasty. </li>
<li>A Mamluk is &nbsp;a Turkish slave under the Caliphate. The Mamluk refers to the Mamluk empire or dynasty and its people. Now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, onto the basics. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 3 
<ul>
<li>The empire was formed in the year 1250 and lasted until 1517 as an independent empire, a time span of 267 years. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 4 
<ul>
<li>The Mamluks ruled an area over a part of Africa and Asia (Syria). Their capital was located in Cairo, Egypt. If you travel to Egypt, parts of the Mamluk dynasty still remain. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 5 
<ul>
<li>The Mamluks were Turkish slaves who were the soldiers in the military of the Abbasid Caliphate. Caliph al-Mu&rsquo;tasim used these Mamluks to boost the strength of his army. </li>
<li>After his demise, Turkish Mamluks slowly rebelled by killing or deposing caliphs. </li>
<li>The caliphate lost power and became merely a symbol of authority. Mamluk generals held the real power. </li>
<li>Dynasties formed consisted of sultans who were originally Mamluks or descendants of these slaves. </li>
<li>They overthrew the caliph and claimed control of an area. </li>
<li>By the 13th century, they had established their presence in Egypt and India. </li>
<li>Aybak was the first Mamluk sultan, married the wife of the last Ayyubid Caliph, and ruled from 1250 to 1257.</li>
<li>The first leaders after him were elite Turkish or Mongol slave officers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 6 
<ul>
<li>The Mamluks government was basically structured as an oligarchy and was based on a military fief system. Slaves were the lowest class, superseded by a small middle class, then nobles, with the sultan having the most power. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 7 
<ul>
<li>The system of succession was not hereditary - unlike in lots of other governments where sons would follow their fathers. In Mamluk society, this was the exception rather than the rule. </li>
<li>In the early ages of the Mamluk empire, sons often followed their fathers, but after 1390 this changed into gaining power through force. In fact, slaves did not even have the right to claim someone as part of their family, so they had no way to prove a hereditary relationship. </li>
<li>This caused bloody battles between prospective sultans. The system was therefore inefficient and very violent. </li>
<li>The sultan successor was chosen based on prior military experience and rose up the chain of command through promotions. </li>
<li>The government was controlled by the military rather than being separate units. Soldiers directed the administration and monitored civilian officials. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 8 
<ul>
<li>Here&rsquo;s another way to look at it. </li>
<li>If a slave was charismatic and had good ideas, he could become a sultan of great power. In most dynasties, slaves had very little power. This forced the slaves to be the lowest class. However, Mamluk society was unique in its allowance for slaves to potentially gain power. </li>
<li>The sultan was elected by a council of amirs.</li>
<li>A military elite was trained to run the governement smoothly. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 9 
<ul>
<li>The government was very complex. No matter how many rights the lower classes had, the most powerful officials were Muslims of Mamluk origin, that is, not Egyptian. There were still quite a few Islamic elements, as the amir still had a lot of power.</li>
<li>The sultan was the head of state. He had advisers and administrators, similar to the President&rsquo;s Cabinet today. He had his own personal Mamluk slaves and was protected by bodyguards, like a Secret Service. These personal slaves could gain power and become one of the sultan&rsquo;s advisers, and these people could then become governors. These people made up the governmental body. </li>
<li>The Mamluk slaves of these people and some amirs were the bulk of the military. There were also some foreigners in the army; however ranking officials were all of Mamluk origin. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 10 
<ul>
<li>The era of Mamluk rule is broken into two periods : 1250-1382 and 1382-1517. They are referred to as the Bahri and Burji by Western historicans, due to the political dominance of these groups during the time. Contemporary Muslim historicans call them the Turkish and Cirassian due to the change in the dominant ethnicity.</li>
<li>The Turkish period was known as a time of growth and expansion. The empire reached its height during this time. </li>
<li>But the Cirassian period was a time of perpetual decline and let to their failure. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 11 
<ul>
<li>The Mamluks were followers of Islam. Unlike other prior dynasties, however, their orthopraxy, or practice of beliefs, had strayed from that of their predecessors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 12 
<ul>
<li>For example, political and religious authority was secularized under Mamluk rule. In the mid-thirteenth century Mamluk perception of jihad became more ideological and less literal. This was encouraged by the Sultan Baybar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 13 
<ul>
<li>Later, the Mamluks returned to the defense of Islam.</li>
<li>The Mamluks withstood the Crusades. They fought in the back end of this Holy War, as the support for the Crusades was waning. </li>
<li>That victory over the Mongols saved Islam. The Mongols had devastated the whole eastern side of the Islamic Caliphate. The Christians were hoping for a final eradication of Islam from the world, but clearly that didn&rsquo;t happen. </li>
<li>Think: Where would we be today if the Mamluks had lost, maybe erasing Islam from the face of the Earth?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 14 
<ul>
<li>Notice how the three most important cities of Islam are contained within the empire. Thus the Mamluk empire encompassed the heart of Islam at the time, and was an important part of Islamic society. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 15 
<ul>
<li>Not only did the Mamluk empire contain three holy cities, but Cairo, the capital city of the Mamluk empire, was the economic center of the Muslim world. It was the Mamluk&rsquo;s cultural and theological capital. </li>
<li>The Mamluks encouraged scholars, so it follows that Cairo was the site of the leading school of Muslim studies. This university, located at the Al-azhar mosque, attracted scholars from all over the Muslim world. </li>
<li>It wasn&rsquo;t on the level of the House of Wisdom, in Bagdhad, but it was certainly quite a prominent place. </li>
<li>Since everyone knew Arabic, it allowed for easy and intellectual conversation between scholars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 16 
<ul>
<li>This video shows the ruins of a Mamluk mosque in Cairo. The mosqure is located near the Citadel of Cairo, and has survived nearly 700 years. That&rsquo;s a LONG time. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 17 
<ul>
<li>The Mamluks, like most civilizations, left its mark on the world with their contributions to society. Some of their most major achievements were:</li>
<li>The Mamluks had a vibrant culture. They had a successful war machine and skills in diplomacy.</li>
<li>They were the only dynasty to withstand Mongol invasion. Also, the survived the Ottoman invasion until 1517 and ruled as Ottoman governors.</li>
<li>They fought against the last Crusade, the ninth, led by the Baybars.</li>
<li>Historical Writings</li>
<li>Architecture in Cairo lasts until this day. </li>
<li>They also built tombs, mosques, schools, and monasteries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 18 
<ul>
<li>They also had several famous people. </li>
<li>Baybars I is a larger-than-life sultan in Arab legend. He revived the Abbasid caliphate at Cairo, the capital. A powerful sultan, he defeated the Mongols in 1260. mamluk culture flourished under his rule.</li>
<li>Al-Malik al-Nasir had great architecture created under his reign. </li>
<li>Also living during this time was Ibn Khaldun, who is recognized as the greatest social historian and philosopher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 19 
<ul>
<li>The Mamluks were contributed to the invention of playing cards. Now, they weren&rsquo;t the absolute first to have playing cards, but they did help to introduce it to Europe. </li>
<li>Mamluk playing cards were discovered at the Topkapi museum in Istanbul by L.A. Meyer. He traced them to the 15th century, making them the first playing cards.</li>
<li>*click*</li>
<li>He found five suits: cups, coins, swords, polo sticks, and staffs&hellip; plus one crescent acting as a &ldquo;joker&rdquo;</li>
<li>Each had 10 number cards and four court cards: King, Governor, Second governor, and Helper</li>
<li>*click*</li>
<li>Though later his discovery was found to be flawed... 
<ul>
<li>There are actually four suits, not five</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no joker</li>
<li>&ldquo;Helpers&rdquo; are actually &ldquo;Kings&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 20 
<ul>
<li>These cards are the predecessors of the European playing card, having similar structure and design.</li>
<li>*click*</li>
<li>Mamluk cards spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, eventually to the world.</li>
<li>*click*</li>
<li>These cards are also the predecessors of tarot cards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 21 
<ul>
<li>The Mamuks had very advanced studies in astronomy. Astronomy was an important field in the Mamluk empire, as in all of Islam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 22 
<ul>
<li>Centers of astronomy in Baghdad, Iran, Syria, and Egypt have moved over time to reflect the varying concentrations of scholars. </li>
<li>Mamluk astronomical knowledge built upon the five centuries of Islamic astronomy that preceded it. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 23 
<ul>
<li>The center of astronomy in the Mamluk empire moved over time. Cairo and Damascus had both been important cities for some time, but when two astronomers, Mu&rsquo;ayyad al-Din al-&rsquo;Urdi and Muhily al-Din al-Maghribi, were transferred to an observatory in Cairo, Cairo became more important. </li>
<li>The provinical capital was moved to Damascus in the mid 14th century, and the center followed the Syrain astronomers that went to Damascus. </li>
<li>But when Timur raided Damasus in 1401, the center went back to Cairo. Some of the leading astronomers there were associated with the Azhar mosque. </li>
<li>It remained there until the end of the 16th century when it was moved to Istanbul. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 24 
<ul>
<li>Most of what we know about the Mamluk&rsquo;s astronomy comes from manuscripts and instruments. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 25  
<ul>
<li>Mamluks extensively studied astronomy for astrology, navigation, and timekeeping.</li>
<li>They divided astronomy into five fields: theoretical, mathematical, spherical, science of instruments, and astrology. </li>
<li>Theoretical astronomy, or &lsquo;ilm al-hav&rsquo;a, studied geometric models of the movements of the sun and planets.</li>
<li>Mathematical astronomy, or &lsquo;ilm al-zijat, used these models to determine positions. These were recorded in tables in zijs, of which over 200 are known. </li>
<li>Spherical astronomy, another branch of &lsquo;ilm al-zijat, studied the apparent movement of the stars. This had a practical application: &lsquo;ilm al-migat, timekeeping using the positions of the stars. The only way to keep time was to read and analyze the sun&rsquo;s position in the sky. The same was used to study the stars. </li>
<li>The science of instruments, or &lsquo;ilm al-alat, created instruments for representing this apparent movement, including the celestial sphere, astrolabe, and the quadrant. The quadrant was made to be better than the astrolabe. </li>
<li>Astrology, or &lsquo;ilm ahkam al-nujam, or &lsquo;ilm al-tanjim, was widely practiced in the empire. Unfortunately, few material remains. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 26 
<ul>
<li>Many fragments of Mamluk textiles and embroidery have survived for centuries, partly due to the hot and dry climate of Egypt which helped preserved the fabrics. Surviving in such great detail for 700-800 years is quite amazing. </li>
<li>We aren&rsquo;t sure what the embroidery was used to decorate since most of the samples we have are fragments, but we think that they may have been used to decorate towels, scarves, belts, clothing, and other household items. </li>
<li>The double running stitch was a distinctive characteristic of Mamluk embroidery. It is similar in appearance as the double running stitch of England blackwork in the 16th century. </li>
<li>The fabrics they used include linen, silk, and wool. </li>
<li>Here are a couple examples:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 27 
<ul>
<li>This piece is made of natural beige linen with indigo blue and yellow silk threads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 28 
<ul>
<li>And this piece is made of beige silk with yellow, blue-green, red-brown, and black silk threads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 29 
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, the empire came to a close. </li>
<li>Several factors contributed to their demise.</li>
<li>The reason for most declines are the unstable governments. As policing is reduced, corruption runs rampant and the dynasty or empire will fall apart. The Cricassian government system caused constant struggle for the throne. </li>
<li>The Black Death, occurring from 1347-1349, was a plague that wiped out 1/3 of the Egyptian population. It was one of the worst plagues in Europe&rsquo;s history, so it really took a toll on the Mamluk civilization. &nbsp;</li>
<li>As a result of this reduced population, agricultural production declined, causing incomes to fall. This lowered the amount of money paid to the sultans, so taxes went up. </li>
<li>The Mamluks had once enjoyed a dominance in trade in Mediterranean Europe. Competition from newly opened trade routes and the new Portuguese spice trade competition were detriments to their trading industry.</li>
<li>Constant Mongol and Ottoman struggles created tension in the empire. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slide 30 
<ul>
<li>After many failed attempts, the Ottomans defeated the Mamluks in the year 1517.  
<ul>
<li>While the Mamluks still lived on as a tribal group, the sultanate was destroyed and Egypt and India became provinces of the Ottoman Empire. </li>
<li>Beys rose to power as the leaders of these provinces, staying in power until the French occupation in 1798 ended their rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The empire was finally defeated in 1811 by Muhammad Ali.  
<ul>
<li>Wanting to eliminate his only threat, he invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the Cairo Citadel. </li>
<li>Then, as they arrived, he slaughtered them all. He then sent out his army throughout the empire to take care of the remainder of the military. </li>
<li>This massacre ended the Mamluks&rsquo; empire and regime. </li>
