Cave Paintings,"<p> Cave paintings are the earliest form of recorded history. Most paintings found are of animals being hunted. Scientists believe these are the neolithic man's way of recording a day's hunt. It was often for a ""caveman"" to spray paint over their hands on the walls of the cave, leaving a permanent hand print. This was a type of signature, implying that even in primitive form, man has had a sense of individuality. These paintings tell us much about early man . By use of radiocarbon dating, cave paintings can tell us what tools these ""cavemen"" used and how they lived at specific points of time. Cave paintings teach us the basic evolution of man. </p>","33,000 BC",http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqXVYO10Pic,"http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Phil%20281/Philosophy%20of%20Magic/Paleolithic%20Art/cave_painting_l.jpg,http://agweb.okstate.edu/fourh/aitc/images/agart/lascauxbulls2.jpg,http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/img/news/2011/Lascaux-aurochs.jpg,http://dnp-old.nscl.msu.edu/images/Applications17.gif,http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/tharriso/ast110/cavepaint.jpg,http://www.sacred-texts.com/nel/hyene11.gif,http://www2.ivcc.edu/gender2001/images/cave_painting_horse.jpg,http://worldhistoryforusall.sdsu.edu/images/cave_painting.jpg",http://www.historyofinformation.com/,"http://specialcollections.fiu.edu/new_gems/bzl/brazil18.jpg,http://alum.mit.edu/pages/sliceofmit/files/2009/05/vldordognelascaux1.jpg?w=300,http://autocww.colorado.edu/~toldy3/E64ContentFiles/ArchaeologyAndExcavations/Lascaux.jpg,http://agweb.okstate.edu/fourh/aitc/images/agart/lascauxbulls2.jpg,http://faculty.etsu.edu/kortumr/01prehistory/adobejpgimages/10lascauxlarge.jpg"
Pictographs and Cuneiform,"<p> Cuneiform is the first recorded writing system using symbols rather than pictures. The Sumerians, who lived in Mesopotamia, used reeds and long rods to inscribe symbols into wet clay blocks. These symbols were always made of straight lines, because curved lines would have broken the fragile writing implements. The symbols evolved from crude representations of things to characters representing syllables and letters. </p>","2,500 BC",http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JVO_Rm1K38,"http://www.virginiawestern.edu/faculty/vwhansd/his111/Images/Cuneiform.jpg,http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/specialcollections/exhibits/images/cuneiform-intro.jpg,http://www.unf.edu/classes/freshmancore/core1images/cuneiform-claytablet-isrealmus1.jpg,http://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T389/PictographSumerian.jpg,http://forces.si.edu/soils/images/media/library_038_lg.jpg",,"http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/GLOSSARY/CUNEI.HTM,http://lib.lbcc.edu/handouts/images/egypt/cuneiform.jpg,http://www.ancient.eu.com/uploads/images/93.jpg"
Paper,"<p> Paper was invented in 105 by a Chinese eunuch named Ts'ai Lun. He used sesame fibers to bind together cloth and bark to make a recyclable sheet of paper. Ts'ai Lun's invention was not discovered by the rest of the world until 751, when Muslim invaders captured Chinese paper makers. </p>",105,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrM6kSx9fEg,http://www.international.ucla.edu/asia-archive/lessons/aguilar/earlypaper.jpg,,"http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/tsailun.html,http://writingcenter.mst.edu/images/images_image001.gif,http://units.sla.org/chapter/cwcn/wwest/v12n3/sla2.JPG"
The Printing Press,"<p> The printing press reached its full potential when Johannes Gutenberg made his printing press that harnessed the efficiency of movable type. Guttenberg's printing press allowed words and letters to be moved around or replaced, even after set in place. This made the act of printing a much easier and less precise process. Guttenberg's printing press aided in the development of European science, art, and religion. The first book printed using his printing press was a bible, later known as the Gutenberg Bible. This sparked a sudden growth in stregnth and size of Christianity throughout the known world. </p>",1045,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVFcP-ogvEM,"http://iat.ubalt.edu/courses/old/pbds660.185_sp07/images/news-printing-press.jpg,http://www.peabody.harvard.edu/files/Printing-Press_0.jpg,http://www.alamo.edu/pac/faculty/pmyers/hist1302/gutenbergpress.gif",,"http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi894.htm,http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2155/1792356353_2a2f03a839.jpg,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Chemin_de_ronde_muraille_long.JPG,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Featherbed_Alley_Printshop_Bermuda.jpg,http://hollyricher.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/gutenberg_metal_movable_type1.jpg"
The Typewriter,"<p> The first typewriter was invented in 1829 by William Austin Burt. Many more were patented in the coming years, but it was not until Rasmus Malling-Hansen's 1870 writing ball they could be mass produced. Typewriters were far faster than printing presses at typing individual documents, so messages could be send that much quicker. </p>",1829
Telegraph,"<p>The telegraph has enabled long distance communication to happen almost instantly. Messages in Morse code could be entered on one end of a line then received at the other end. The time the signal took to transfer took a matter of seconds. The telegraph was especially useful when matters of great urgency needed to be communicated instantly. The telegraph's most important use was in time of war. Telegraphs enabled a commander to order and an attack, recall of troops, enemy plots, and orders for machines built in factories. </p> ",1832,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKFDpC2MLro,"http://www.alamo.edu/pac/faculty/pmyers/hist1302/morsetelegraphkey.jpg,http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~st00266/telegraph1.jpg,http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/Ezra-exhibit/EC-life/Screen/E3856_0074.JPEG",http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/telegraph.htm,"http://www.150.si.edu/150trav/remember/r819.htm,http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/archives/images/set2/telegraph1.jpg,http://www.telcomhistory.org/vm/Images/main/science/telegraph2.jpg,http://www.engin.brown.edu/faculty/tripathi/research/IMG_0252.jpg"

Horses,"<p> Horses were likely first domesticated in eastern Europe around 3500 BC, and they have been used in areas ranging from warfare to entertainment. In 1848, the beginning of the California Gold Rush, miners began flooding into the west. At the time, the only was to get mail to the west efficiently was to sail to Panama and take a second ship to San Francisco. The pony express was the simplest solution to this problem. Young riders would travel across the United States in small horses, stopping at checkpoints for food and rest. Ponies were used because they did not require as much grain and water. This method was successful in delivering mail at a cheap cost and in a short amount of time. </p>",1860,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rm1Slyy82w,"http://postalmuseum.typepad.com/.a/6a01157147ecba970c0133eca9f80a970b-500pi,http://www.valdosta.edu/~ksroland/arabianhorse8.jpg,http://hd.housedivided.dickinson.edu/files/images/HD_FrankWebnerponyexpress.preview.jpg",,"http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/resources/6a2b_ponyexpress.html,http://freshwaterorganics.com/horse31024.jpg,http://consumer.discoverohio.com/downloads/freeohioimages/farm.jpg,http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared/9/95/Seurasaari_Stable.JPG"
Telephones and Cell Phones,"<p>The telephone allows the user to talk to anyone in the world regardless of their general location. The telephone takes a user's voice, converts it to an electrical cluster of data, moves across a line, converted back to audio, and then played back to the user at the other end. In the early days of a telephone, every single call went to a human operator who then linked your call via switchboard. As telephones became more advanced and gained widespread usage, the use of a human operator diminished and computer operators became utilized for informational purposes only. In time, phones became wireless allowing the user to move freely. In 1973, the first practical cellular phone was built. Cellular phones allow any two (or more) people anywhere in the world to have a conversion as long as they have a decent signal. </p>",1871,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYgXsUZXFo,"http://chss.montclair.edu/~pererat/i_0040.jpg,http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch2en/conc2en/img/bell_telephone.gif,http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/kgreenber/first+cell+phone.jpg,http://www.personal.psu.edu/swm5212/first%20cell.jpg,http://www.unk.edu/uploadedImages/academics/library/ref/cell-phones.jpg,http://www.depauw.edu/photos/PhotoDB_Repository/2008/4/Flip%20Cell%20Phone.jpg",,"http://www.stanford.edu/group/wais/General/general_whoinvented%2803282004%29.htm,http://farm1.static.flickr.com/52/149727756_1ff1b10194.jpg,http://thisdayintechnology.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Dan-Forbes.jpeg,http://www.preservationnation.org/assets/photos-images/travel-sites/save-americas-treasures/success-stories/Thomas-Edison-s-chem-lab.jpg,http://arch1015.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bell-labs-by-dith-pran-ny-times.jpg"

Pigeons,"<p> Pigeons were first used by the Egyptians and Persians in the 1st millennium BC, followed by the Greeks, who used them to send out the results of the olympics. A few thousand years later, Genghis Khan used pigeons to send messages on the battlefield. This practice was adopted in many later wars, including the two World Wars. In World War I, a French pigeon named Cher Ami delivered a distress message from the trenches to forces 20 miles away, <b>after</b> being shot multiple times in the chest and having lost a leg. In World War II, an American pigeon named GI Joe sent a message to the Italian town of Calvi Vecchia warning everyone of an impending bombing. </p>",1943,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDgL2gh-4YY,"http://www.monmouth.army.mil/museum/photos/gijoe.jpg,http://johnnymuttley.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/gi-joe-pdsa1.jpg",,"http://www.monmouth.army.mil/museum/gijoe.shtml,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Homing_pigeon.jpg,http://www.nps.gov/archive/grca/photos/images/D3223.JPG,http://www.public-domain-photos.com/free-stock-photos-4/travel/grand-canyon/grand-canyon-7.jpg"
ARPAnet/Internet,"<p>""I think most probably that this [internet] technology will be helpful, to get information easily. In that way it will make clear what is truth, what is reality and what is false propaganda. I think that provided each individual uses their own intelligence or mind to investigate further, this technology should be very useful.""
— His Holiness the Dalai Lama <br> <br> The internet is a gigantic library that connects all the computers in the world. The internet allows a seemingly infinite amount of information to be available to fingertips of anyone who has a computer. In today's modern world, the fastest way to spread information is through use of the internet. Any information added by any individual instantly becomes available to the whole world. By use of e-mail and IM chat rooms, then internet becomes the fastest use of communication. Webcams have helped make the video chat (once an idea tossed around by science fiction authors) a reality.</p>",1950,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjX4b149GTc,"http://home.messiah.edu/~mf1234/arpanet-5.jpg,http://student.elon.edu/lrosen2/Arpanet.gif",,"http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/wp/commercialism/history-of-the-internet.htm,http://paidcontent.org/images/old_images/uploads/net_image.jpg,http://people.csail.mit.edu/vganesh/Pictures_files/MIT-Dome.jpg,http://www.bradvisors.com/uploads/Image/University_Park_at_MIT.jpg"

Microprocessors,"<p> The first microprocessor was the Intel 4004 processor, but they have become exponentially smaller. They will eventually stop shrinking because of Moore's Law, which prevents too many silicon microchips from fitting on one space. These aided communication because they could be mass produced, allowing the computer to become more widely spread. </p>",1971
